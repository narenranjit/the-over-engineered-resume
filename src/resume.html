  I thrive at the intersection of product and engineering, leading teams in crafting products so seamless they feel
  invisible. I've helped launch multiple 0-1 products, bridging vision and execution by shipping fast and iterating
  often. I've scaled organizations through explosive growth and guided them during downturns, with a constant focus on
  resilience and adaptability. I foster engineering cultures that thrive on curiosity, speed, and purpose, where teams
  take initiative, act with clarity, and embrace risks, knowing that learning fuels growth.
